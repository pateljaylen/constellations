# Product Overview

Constellation is built around one simple cycle:

1. Assign 4 questions to each person on their designated week.
2. Capture their reflections, photos, music, and sentiment.
3. Compile the group’s responses into a monthly “Wrapped”.
4. Convene — digitally or in person — to celebrate the month.

From this, the platform unlocks:

- A personal journal that evolves with every answer.
- A group archive that deepens relationships over time.
- Insights into mood, growth patterns, emotional vocabulary, and values.
- A shared identity that strengthens community.

Constellation is designed to be lightweight yet profound.
A rhythm strong enough to create meaning, but gentle enough to fit your life.

Key Principles:
- Minimal input, maximal reflection.
- Emotional safety through optional recency or timeless storytelling.
- Beauty and clarity in every surface.
- Ritual over engagement.
- Connection over content.
