# Vision

Most people move through adulthood without a record of who they are becoming.
Moments pass, friendships drift, and stories stay untold. Community becomes
something we remember rather than something we maintain.

Constellation exists to reverse that.

We believe:
- People grow when they are witnessed.
- Reflection is the simplest and most powerful form of self-awareness.
- Small groups — not large networks — are where meaning actually forms.
- The future of community is structured, intentional, and emotionally literate.
- A life observed becomes a life understood.

Constellation creates small rituals of depth:
4 questions. One week. One story at a time.

When reflected through a community, these small rituals compound into something
beautiful: a mosaic of growth, vulnerability, creativity, and shared humanity.

Constellation is a container for becoming. 
A way to track the seasons of your life.
A way to stay close without being constantly online.

We are designing the emotional infrastructure of the modern tribe.
