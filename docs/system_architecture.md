# System Architecture (Conceptual)

Constellation has four pillars:

1. **The Cadence Engine**
   - Assigns members their reflection week.
   - Balances distribution across month.
   - Accounts for holidays, missed weeks, and group size.

2. **The Reflection Engine**
   - Serves 4 curated questions to each user.
   - Supports writing, photos, music, sentiment.
   - Stores all responses in a timeless personal archive.

3. **The Wrapped Engine**
   - Analyzes text for themes, sentiment, and highlights.
   - Curates photos, quotes, and shared moments.
   - Generates a monthly story for the entire group.

4. **The Community Layer**
   - Group home.
   - Photo galleries.
   - Sentiment arcs and identity maps.
   - Convening tools and event discovery.

These pieces work together quietly — 
a calm system beneath a human experience.

The architecture prioritizes:
- Emotional clarity over feature complexity.
- Long-term memory over short-term engagement.
- Reflection over reaction.
