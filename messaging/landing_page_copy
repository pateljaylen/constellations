## Headline
A modern ritual for becoming human together.

## Subheadline
Small groups. Monthly reflection. Shared stories.  
A life observed is a life understood.

## Body
Constellation helps you grow with the people who matter.

Each month:
• You receive four high-signal questions  
• You answer with stories, photos, music, and mood  
• Your group receives a beautiful “Wrapped” — a mosaic of the month  

It’s not a social network.  
It’s a sanctuary for reflection and connection.

## Secondary Section — Why It Matters
We move fast. Too fast to notice who we’re becoming.

Constellation slows the moment just enough to capture it —  
to understand your life in motion, and to share that journey with others.
