# Phase 1 — MVP

The MVP must deliver the core ritual:
reflection → collection → celebration.

Requirements:
- Group creation + invite flow
- User accounts and onboarding
- Cadence engine (manual or automated)
- 4-question assignment + delivery
- Reflection submission (text + photos + sentiment)

- Group receives first monthly wrap.
- People feel closer — to themselves and each other.
