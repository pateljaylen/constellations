📩 Email 1 — Welcome to Your Constellation

Subject: You’re In — Welcome to Your Constellation 🌟

Hi [Name],

You’ve joined a Constellation — a small group of people who have chosen to grow, reflect, and stay connected in a deeper way.

Here’s what to expect:

• You’ll receive 4 reflection prompts on your assigned week  
• You’ll answer in your own time — stories, photos, music, mood  
• At the end of the month, our group will receive a “Wrapped”  
  — a mosaic of the moments and meanings we lived through together

Constellation isn’t a social network.  
It’s a ritual. A mirror. A record of who we are becoming.

Your first prompts will arrive on: **[Date]**  
We’re glad you’re here.

📩 Email 2 — Your First Prompts Are Ready

Subject: Your Reflection Prompts Are Here ✨

Hi [Name],

This is your week in the Constellation.

Your 4 questions are now ready — gentle invitations to pause, reflect, and
capture a moment from your life. They can be answered from this month or from
any chapter of your story that feels alive today.

Take your time.  
Write what feels true.  
Add a photo or a song if you’d like.  
Let this be a small ritual of noticing.

Start here: [Link to Prompts]

Thank you for showing up — for yourself, and for the group.
