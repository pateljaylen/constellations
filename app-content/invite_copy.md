# Invite Copy

I’m starting a Constellation — a small group built around reflection, story,
and growth. Each of us will receive 4 questions on our assigned week.
At the end of the month, we’ll get a “Spotify Wrapped”-style summary of our
collective experiences.

It’s a way to stay connected, understand ourselves better, and build a record
of our becoming.

If you want to be part of this, join here:

It’s simple, meaningful, and genuinely life-expanding.
