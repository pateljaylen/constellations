# Monthly Wrapped Narrative Template
A soft, cinematic structure for transforming a group’s reflections into a story.

The Monthly Wrapped is not analytics.  
It is not a dashboard.  
It is a moment of meaning — a portrait of a month lived together.

Use this structure to generate the narrative each month.

---

# 1. Opening Image / Line
Choose one photo or one line that captures the month’s emotional center.

---

# 8. Closing Reflection
A single paragraph that feels like the soft closing of a storybook.

Example:
“This month reminded us that becoming doesn’t happen all at once. It happens in the quiet moments, the small choices, the steps we almost didn’t take. And yet, together, we took them.”

---

# 9. Call to Gather
Light, warm, inviting.

“Our next constellation gathering is on [Date].
