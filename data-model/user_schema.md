# User Schema (Conceptual)

Users represent individuals participating in one or more constellations.

Fields:
- id
- name
- email
- avatar_url
- created_at
- sentiment_baseline
- personal_insights (JSON)
- mood_history (time series)
- values_indicators (JSON)
- photo_library (array of media IDs)

Narrative:
A user is not a profile. A user is a story in motion.
Their data reflects emotional and cognitive patterns over time — not static traits.
